### 🎯 Overview
**Blob Rush** is a 2D platformer developed collaboratively during the **Nuit du Code 2023** hackathon — a national French competition where participants have **8 hours** to design and code a playable game from scratch using **Pyxel**.  
Our team, composed of classmates from high school, built this project under a single evening deadline — blending creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork.

The result: a **transforming player** who alternates between human and blob forms, collects coins, and navigates ladders and obstacles across a scrolling level.

---

### 🧩 Gameplay
Your goal is simple:
> **Collect all 8 coins** scattered across the level while staying alive.

You can switch between **two forms**:
- 🧍‍♂️ **Human** – agile, jumps normally  
- 🫧 **Blob** – can accelerate, jump higher, and leave an animated trail  

Avoid traps, climb ladders, and reach every hidden coin!

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Engine:** [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)  
- **Assets:** `graphics.pyxres` (custom tiles & sprites)  
- **Core Files:** `game_engine.py` (logic, collisions, scroll, physics)  
- **Concept Doc:** `cahierdecharges` (in French, design notes)

---

### 💡 Hackathon Experience & Learning
This project was my **first hackathon** and the first time I worked on software in a real-time, team-based environment.  
It taught me:
- Rapid prototyping and feature prioritization  
- Efficient communication and task splitting under pressure  
- Game-loop logic, physics, and tile-based collisions  
- Time-boxing ideas and managing trade-offs between polish and feasibility  

These lessons now guide how I structure and execute collaborative projects — from hackathons to academic group work and internships.

### 🌱 Connection to My Current Goals
**Blob Rush** marked a turning point in my development path: it combined teamwork, creativity, and technical problem-solving — the same skills I now use when building **AI-powered and interactive applications**.  
The experience strengthened my interest in using technology for fast iteration and creative design under real-world constraints.
